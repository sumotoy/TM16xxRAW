TM16xxRAW
=========

An easy universal library for TM1638/40 chip (not the board usually selled on ebay). Useful for easy interface

There's another library around that works really well but it's for the ready made board (with several 7 seg displays and some switches).
This library it's intended for use with leds,switches or 8x8 matrix led modules so it's very useful for create interfaces with
more than 64 leds and 24 switches all individually drived.
The library can be easily integrated in other libraries and I will provide extra modules for matrix displays, 7seg displays,
14seg displays and so on.
The basic library can access every single led (till 64 but can be expanded with additional 16) and can check a matrix of 24 switches,
it occupy just 1k2and has small ram imprint
